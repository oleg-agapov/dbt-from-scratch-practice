# Practice 3: Improving the project

In this practice, we will improve the project by refactoring the models to modeling layers and implement project-wise configs using `dbt_project.yml`.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: learn best practices of structuring dbt projects for scalability and modularity.

## Step 1: Implement staging layer

Staging layer id one-to-one reflection of source tables in the data warehouse.

Create a new directory `models/staging`. Inside of staging folder we usually create structure that reflects our datasource. In our case we could create a subfolder called `dunder_mifflin`, because all our data is coming from that source.

Inside of `dunder_mifflin` let's create several files:

<details>
    <summary>dunder_mifflin__sources.yml</summary>

    This is the same file as in the previous practice.

    You can just copy existing file from the previous practice.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>stg_dunder_mifflin__categories.sql</summary>

    ```sql
    with source as (
        select * from {{ source('dunder_mifflin', 'categories') }}
    ),

    renamed as (
        select
            category_id,
            category_name,
            description as category_description,
            picture
        from source
    )

    select * from renamed
    ```

</details>
